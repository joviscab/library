# Odin Project - Library

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Library and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Objects and Object Constructors knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build Library app, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The Library app will consist in a single page that store informations about books.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Javascript Objects and Object Constructors skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
